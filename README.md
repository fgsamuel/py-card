## Code Quality

The project uses some well-known libraries in the market to guarantee the quality of the code and the maintainability of the project over time.

**Pre-commit**: It is a library that performs some checks and is already configured in the project.
To run it, just run the command `pre-commit run -a`
If in doubt, visit the [official website](https://pre-commit.com/).

**Lint**: The project has a script that runs all of the project's code quality and style tools.
It can be run with the command `./scripts/lint.sh`

Before committing, it is mandatory to run these tools.
